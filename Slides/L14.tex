    \begin{itemize}
        \item EVM provides useful measure of phase noise in recovered signal
        \begin{itemize}
         \item Helps understand algorithmic performance of Systems
         \item Measures residual error of constellation with respect to reference position
        \end{itemize}
        \item Following mathematical expression used to calculate EVM in percent RMS:
        \begin{equation}
         \mathrm{EVM}_{\mathrm{RMS}}=100\cdot\left(\sqrt{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1}e_{\mathrm{const}}(k)}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1}((\Re(\bar{y}(k)))^2+(\Im(\bar{y}(k)))^2)\right)
        \end{equation}
	and:
	\begin{equation}
	 e_{\mathrm{const}}(k)=(\Re(y(k))-\Re(\bar{y}(k)))^2+(\Im(y(k))-\Im(\bar{y}(k)))^2
	\end{equation}
	where $\bar{y}(k)$ is the reference symbol for $y(k)$
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item EVM is a measure of dispersiveness of received signal $\rightarrow$ Lower EVM is better
   \item Sometimes EVM is represented in decibels:
   \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{EVM}_{\mathrm{dB}}=20\log_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{EVM}_{\mathrm{RMS}}}{100}\right)
   \end{equation}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Phase Ambiguity}
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Occurs when FFC synchronizer is blind to true orientation of transmitted signal
   \item Symmetric modulation schemes may have a number of convergent orientations for its signal constellation 
   \item There exists several approaches to help achieve the correct signal constellation] orientation
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Codewords
    \item Differential Encoding
    \item Equalizers
   \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\frame
{
  \frametitle{Differential Encoding}
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item To correct for phase ambiguity, differentially encode the source bits
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Makes true data dependent on difference between successive bits instead of just the received bits themselves
   \end{itemize}
    \item Encoding performed using modulo-2 addition:
    \begin{equation}
     b_t(n)=b_t(n-1)\oplus{b(n)}
    \end{equation}
    while decoding is performed using the following expression:
    \begin{equation}
     b(n)=b_t(n)\oplus{b_t(n-1)}
    \end{equation}
    where $b_t(n)$ are the transmitted bits while $b(n)$ are the untransmitted bits
  \end{itemize}
