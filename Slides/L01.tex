\begin{frame}[fragile]{Course Objectives}

What we are focusing on in this course:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Conduct various performance analyses of digital communication systems, \textit{e.g.}, bit error rate, power efficiency
 \item Implement digital communication systems using software defined radio technology
 \item Understand real-world issues with over-the-air data transmission, \textit{e.g.} timing errors, frequency offset
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Course Objectives}

What we are \textbf{not} covering in this course:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Channel models
 \item Networking protocols
 \item Analog communication systems or any baseband communication systems
 \item Antenna design
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Tools}

Three tools to be mastered during this course:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Mathematical analysis
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Extensively based on discrete time signals and systems
  \item Some probability theory will be employed
 \end{itemize}
 \item Computer simulation
 \begin{itemize}
  \item MATLAB to be used throughout course and will only be supported
 \end{itemize}
 \item Software defined radio hardware
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Analog Devices ADALM-PLUTO will be used, although other SDR systems can be employed
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
