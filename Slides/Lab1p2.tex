\begin{frame}[fragile]{Digital Phase Locked Loop Functionality}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Ideally when we sample $y(t)$ to get the digital version of it, $y[n]$, we would like to only get the correct samples of the transmission
 \item However, our radios operate on a different clock and there might be a timing offset $\tau$ between transmitter and receiver
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $\tau$ is a fractional timing offset
 \end{itemize} 
 \item We need some sort of way to compensate for $\tau$
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Zero-crossing
  \item M\"{u}ller-Mueller
  \item Gardner
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Zero-Crossing Approach}

\begin{itemize}
 \item The goal of the timing error detector (TED) is to obtain an error signal $e[n]$ that is equal to zero
 \begin{itemize}
  \item When this occurs, our interpolator is sampling perfectly at the correct timing instants
 \end{itemize}
 \item The mathematical expression of the TED for determining $e[n]$ is:
 \begin{align}
  e[n]=&\Re\{y((k-0.5)T_s+\tau)\}\cdot\nonumber\\
  &(\sgn(\Re\{y((k-1)T_s+\tau)\})-\sgn(\Re\{y(kT_s+\tau)\}))+\nonumber\\
  &\Im\{y((k-0.5)T_s+\tau)\}\cdot\nonumber\\
  &(\sgn(\Im\{y((k-1)T_s+\tau)\})-\sgn(\Im\{y(kT_s+\tau)\}))
 \end{align}

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Timing Error Detection}

So how does this work? 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Suppose our controller chooses a value of $\tau$
 \item If the value of $\tau$ is such that we select the correct sampling instants of two consecutive symbols, then we have one of two possible conditions:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item If both symbols have the same amplitude, then $\sgn(\Re\{y((k-1)T_s+\tau)\})$ and $\sgn(\Re\{y(kT_s+\tau)\})$ should cancel each other out and the $e[n]$ expression should equal zero
  \item If the symbols are of opposite amplitude, then the midway point between them should equal zero and the $e[n]$ expression should equal zero
 \end{itemize}
 \item If the value of $\tau$ is such that we did not select the correct sampling instants of two consecutive symbols, then $e[n]$ will not be equal to zero and we will need to try a new $\tau$
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Loop Filter Design}

Once we have $e[n]$, the next step is to apply the loop filter
\begin{itemize}
 \item This provides gradual transitions that the controller can act upon such that we avoid rapid variations in the error signal
\end{itemize}

The loop filter is equal to:
\begin{equation}
 F(z)=G_1+\frac{G_2}{1-z^{-1}}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{align}
 \theta=\frac{B_{\mathrm{Loop}}}{M(\psi+0.25/\psi)},\quad\Delta=1+2\psi\theta+\psi^2\\
 G_1=\frac{4\psi\theta/\Delta}{M},\quad{G_2}=\frac{4|theta^2/\Delta}{M}
\end{align}
such that $B_{\mathrm{Loop}}$ is the loop filter bandwidth and $\psi$ is the preferred dampening factor

\end{frame}

The controller is responsible for handling the adjustment of the fractional delay $\tau$ and its application to the interpolator
